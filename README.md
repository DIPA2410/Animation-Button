Create an Animation button

1)Create an HTML file with a button element.

2) Apply the following CSS techniques to the button to make it interactive and visually appealing:
Use CSS transitions to animate the button's background color, text color, or border.
Implement a hover effect, where the button changes appearance when a user hovers their mouse over it.
Use CSS animations to create a more complex animation, such as a pulsating or fading effect.

3) The button should smoothly transition its styles over a defined duration when hovered over and return to its original state when the mouse is not hovering.

4) You can be creative with your design and experiment with various properties like hover, transition, animation, and keyframes to achieve the desired visual effect.

5) Make sure to test your animated button in different browsers to ensure compatibility.
